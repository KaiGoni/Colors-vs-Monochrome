# Colors vs Monochrome
Colors vs Monochrome was originally imagined to be a unique spinoff of many tower defense games, but never saw daylight in 2022, until a school game jam in May 2023. The game is nowhere near complete, and is written in [love2d](https://love2d.org/), a 2d game framework in lua.
